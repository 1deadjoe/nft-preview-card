## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I finally got to use SASS in styling instead of vanilla CSS. It is a great tool to use and it somehow makes code cleaner. This small project was a very great way to kickstart that learning journey.

### Continued development

I want to use SASS more when styling websites. In addition, I want to delve into animations and get conversant with them.
